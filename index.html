	<h1>CSS Overview</h1>
	<p>In this overview, <span>Codecademy</span> starts talking about stylesheets. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to format your HTML. The style sheet is a file that describes how an HTML file should look.</p>
	<p>The reason you would separate your formatting from your structure, is that you can apply the same formatting to several HTML elements without having to rewrite the code, over and over again. Addiionally you can apply similar appearance and formatting to several HTML pages from a single CSS file. </p>
